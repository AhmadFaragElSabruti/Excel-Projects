## 📘 US Debt Tracker Project

### 🧭 Overview

This project analyzes the **United States Public Debt** from 1993 to 2023 using daily Treasury data. It focuses on:

- **Debt Held by the Public**
- **Intragovernmental Holdings**
- **Total Public Debt Outstanding**

The analysis was commissioned by a Washington DC-based debt agency to support federal fiscal planning and transparency.

### 📊 Key Results & Conclusions

#### 📈 1. Yearly Debt Percentage Increase

- **2020** saw the **largest spike** in debt (+19.6%) due to COVID-19 stimulus packages.
- **2021–2022** showed moderate growth (~6–7%), reflecting post-pandemic recovery.
- **2023** (YTD) growth is minimal (~0.11%), likely due to debt ceiling constraints.

#### 📅 2. Monthly Debt Trends

- **January and December** consistently show **higher debt increases**, aligning with budget cycles and end-of-year adjustments.
- **April** tends to show **lower increases**, possibly due to tax revenue inflows.

#### 📉 3. Debt Composition Shifts

- **Debt Held by the Public** now comprises ~78–80% of total debt, indicating a shift away from intragovernmental borrowing.
- **Intragovernmental Holdings** have plateaued or declined in recent years.

#### 📊 4. Forecasting Public Debt

- Based on recent trends, **public debt is projected to exceed $35 trillion by 2026**, assuming current growth rates persist.
- Growth is expected to slow unless new fiscal stimuli or emergencies arise.
